# Welcome to F# Graphics Examples 
F# is an awesome statically typed functional-first programming language for the .net platform. This website presents some examples of writing graphics applications in F#.  Here "graphics" is meant
loosely and includes 3D graphics, 2D graphics and GUI applications. We are starting first with 3D programming,
particularly DirectX 11 programming, but plan to expand the coverage slowly to cover many different topics. 

## Prerequisites

This website is for people who:

* Have programming experience and know what types, functions, classes etc. are
* Are a little familiar with F# syntax but may not be experts 
* Wanted to build some graphics applications 

## What this website is not

This is not meant to be:

* A complete resource on 3D programming. You will need to do some self-reading about topics such as 3D math.
* An introduction to programming for non-programmers. I assume some programming knowledge and experience and don't
hold your hand.
